# Random-Walk-NFT
Submission for the 2021 Chainlink Hackathon.
This repo worked on concurrently with https://github.com/jstat17/Solidity-Math .
Made using Remix IDE.

## Ethereum-based random walk NFT
A smartcontract that can generate verifiably random walks (using Chainlink VRF), which produces a plot of points that look like a treasure map starting at the origin and ending at some arbitarily-random point.
The frontend webpage used to interact with the smartcontract can use a python script to display the generated map using the NFT's randomly generated 2-D nodes.
